## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1. ft_linear_regression

A simple implementation of **linear regression** used to predict car prices based on mileage.

#### Features
- **Prediction Program**
  - Estimates car price using the formula:
    ```
    estimatePrice = theta0 + (theta1 × mileage)
    ```
- **Training Program**
  - Uses **gradient descent** to optimize `theta0` and `theta1` on a given dataset.

#### Bonus
- Data visualization (scatter plot + regression line)
- Model precision evaluation

📚 *This project serves as an introduction to machine learning concepts such as optimization, cost functions, and model evaluation.*
