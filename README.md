## ft_linear_regression

This project implements linear regression to predict car prices based on mileage. It includes:

1. A prediction program that estimates price using 
estimatePrice = theta0 + (theta1 × mileage).

2. A training program that optimizes theta0 and theta1 using gradient descent on a dataset.

Bonus: Visualize data and regression line, and calculate model precision.

A simple yet practical introduction to machine learning.
